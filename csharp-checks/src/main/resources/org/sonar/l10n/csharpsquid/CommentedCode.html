<p>
Where it is required for sections of source code not to be compiled then this should be achieved by use of conditional compilation (e.g. #if construct with a comment).
Using start and end comment markers for this purpose is dangerous because C# does not support nested comments, and any comments already existing in the section of code would change the effect.

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
using System;

class Program
{
  // This line is fine, but the following is not
  //int Id = 0;

  /*
  The following line is bad

  void Test() { int dirId = this.Id++; }

  No violation on the following line, because there is at most one violation per comment
  MyMethod();
  */

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
  }
}
</pre>
